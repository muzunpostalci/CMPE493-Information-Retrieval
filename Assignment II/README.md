# Assignment II - Movie Review Classification with Naive Bayes
In this project I have implemented Naive Bayes classifiers (Multinomial, Bernoulli and Binary) for identifying the sentiment of a given movie review as a positive or negative.

## Files
`test` and `train` folders contains movie reviews that are tagged as positive or negative. There are 700 positive and 700 negative training files and 300 positive and 300 negative test files.

## Model
I have implemented and trained Multinomial, Bernoulli and Binary Naive Bayes models separately. Definition and more information about Naive Bayes can be found [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/4.pdf).

## Execution of the Program
I have implemented the models on python3. `train` and `test` folders must be present while executing the program.
```bash
python3 naiveBayes.py
```
Detailed information and results can be found on the report.
